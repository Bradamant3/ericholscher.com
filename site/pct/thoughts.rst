.. note:: This was written on the trail in Idyllwild, mile ~150.

The trail has been an amazing mental experience as well. I've run into some amazing people, and it's only been about 10 days. I've hiked with the same group (Team Horseshoe) until now, and have leap-frogged a few other groups (Team America, Skip & 2Step, Legend, Double Sprainbow & Ollie, Mike & Jill). It feels like I've known these folks for years, and it's been less than 2 weeks. The trail builds an amazing kind of rapport, where you can let your guard down and get to know people well. The removal of "What do you do?" from the common vocabulary of life is a welcome one. It feels like you get farther into the interesting tidbits of life faster. The small talk becomes deeper.

I've heard about a study that says people are more creative in rooms with taller ceilings. Out here it feels like there is no ceiling, and along with that no limit to how one might think about the world. It's neat seeing what creative ways people have of eating, sleeping, walking. All of these things we take for granted in everyday life become all there is, and each person has a different take on it.

Under the stars at night, the mind is free to wonder. There are no deadlines, no bosses, and no force to the way of life. Everyone is here because they want to be, kindred spirits from across the globe. They come together for the most fruitless and senseless act, to walk, yet it means so much at the same time. The act of removing yourself from society ("the other world") is a strong statement, while, also being a very easy one. So much about walking this path feels right, much more than walking down a street ever has.

So it continues, only 10 days in, the great migration along the path of most resistance. As a great man once said, the best adventures answer questions that you didn't even know to ask.
