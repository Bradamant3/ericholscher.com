About me
========

I currently call "home" Portland, Oregon. However, I will be walking from Mexico to Canada along the Pacific Crest Trail, this year, 2013. I will be taking a walk in the woods, to try and find the grail.

I have previously lived in Lawrence, Kansas for 2.5 years from May 2010-Dec 2012. I lived the rest of my life in Virginia, migrating from the Shennendoah Valley, to Virginia Beach for high school, then to Fredericksburg for college.

I've previously worked at these awesome companies:

    * Urban Airship
    * Lawrence Journal-World
