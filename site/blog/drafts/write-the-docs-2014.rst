Write the Docs 2014
===================

We are excited to announce the Write the Docs schedule for 2014.
We had such a great time in 2013,
we have decided to expand this year.
There will be two conferences,
one in North America and one in Europe.

* Write the Docs EU will be in **Budapest, Hungary on March 31-April 1**.
* Write the Docs NA will be in **Portland, Oregon on May 5-6**.

Both of these dates are on a Monday and Tuesday.

For the uninitiated,
Write the Docs is a conference where the art and science of documentation can be
practiced and appreciated.
There are a lot of people out there who write docs,
but there isn't a good place to go to find information,
ask questions, and generally be a member of a community of documenters.
We hope to slowly solve this problem by building a place with high quality
information about the art of writing documentation.
Along with that, 
we hope to open communication between all the awesome
people out there writing documentation.
