Read the Docs goes full-time
============================

We have some exciting news in Read the Docs land this week.
The project has been `accepted into`_ the Portland Incubator Experiment,
as an open source project.
This means that we have office space provided to us in Portland for 3 months,
where we will be working on Read the Docs full-time.
There will be two of us working on this:
`Eric Holscher`_ and `Anthony Johnson`_.

This is a fantastic opportunity for the project.
Having two engineers working on it for three months will enable us to build a lot of useful things.
This week is the first week,
and we have already triaged the entire issue tracker and launched a few new features.

New Features
------------

Historically,
we haven't had a great way to announce new features.
We would tweet them from the `@readthedocs`_ account,
and hope people followed us.
This isn't a great format for showing new things.

Today we are announcing a new blog: http://blog.readthedocs.com/
We will be doing regular feature announcements on the blog as we build them.
There are also a number of recently released features that we'll highlight there as well.
If blogs aren't your thing,
you can also choose to get that content via email:

Sustainability
--------------

The main goal of this project is to make Read the Docs a sustainable open source project.
This means that we will be able to create new features and support hosting the project for years to come.
We will have more information on this front in the next few weeks,
as we figure out what we will be doing.

We really believe in the mission and potential of Read the Docs to really improve the state of documentation in software,
and we are really happy with how far we've come.
However,
this is just the beginning,
and we look forward to building the future with you.
