Read the Docs For Business
==========================

We `created`_ Read the Docs over four years ago,
as an open source project to solve a problem we had.
Since then,
it `has grown`_ more than I ever could have `imagined`_.
It has become vital infrastructure for the Python community,
and the `programming world`_ in general.

Read the Docs has always been a volunteer effort for me.
I have gotten small amounts from `Gittip`_ over the years,
but compared to developer salary,
it is peanuts.
It has been a labor of love because I `really believe`_ in improving documentation for developers.

Sadly,
the way the world works,
companies are where money is stored.
It is 10 times harder to get a company to donate money to a project,
than to buy a product.
Asking individuals to give us money instead of companies is asking the people who are actually doing the work to support us.
The companies benefiting from Open Source should be supporting the ecosystem much more than they are.

I also believe that companies have the same issues with documentation that open source has.
Read the Docs has always been open source,
so some companies have installed it locally.
Today,
we are adding the ability to have us host it for companies.

This site will live at readthedocs.com

Why a .com and a .org
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I love readthedocs.org,
and I never want anything to happen to it.
readthedocs.com is a seperate entity,
that has been established to bring Read the Docs to business.

This has been a lot of work.
Having both live on the same domain would be much easier.
However,
we strongly believe readthedocs.org should never be part of `an incredible journey`_.

Read the Docs for Business has been created to help fund our work on the code base.
However, the fate of readthedocs.org is not tied to the fate of the business.
We believe readthedocs.org should be a resource available to the programming community forever,
and we are doing everything in our power to make sure that happens.

Our work creating a company is to help make both the open source and corporate documentation worlds better.
We believe Read the Docs solves a real need in the software world,
and we hope you join us in the next stage.

Our mission it to build world-class documentation tools for developers,
and we would love to have you aboard.

Cheers,
Eric
