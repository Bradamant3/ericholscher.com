Announcing Read the Docs For Business
=====================================

| tl;dr: We are launching https://readthedocs.com 
| Nothing about https://readthedocs.org is going to change.

I helped `create`_ Read the Docs over four years ago,
as an open source project to solve a problem we had.
Since then,
it `has grown`_ more than I ever could have `imagined`_.
It has become vital infrastructure for the Python community,
and the `programming world`_ in general.

Read the Docs has always been a volunteer effort for me.
I have gotten small amounts from `Gittip`_ over the years,
but compared to developer salary,
it is peanuts.
It has been a labor of love because I `really believe`_ in improving documentation for developers [#f1]_.

The way the world works,
companies are where money is stored.
It is ten times harder to get a company to donate money to a project than to buy a product.
Asking individuals to give us money instead of companies is asking the people who are actually doing the open source work to support us.
The companies benefiting from open source should be supporting the ecosystem much more than they are.

I also believe that companies have the same issues with documentation that open source has.
Read the Docs has always been open source,
so some companies have installed it locally.
However,
running Read the Docs is not trivial.
There are a lot of moving pieces,
and it requires a good deal of maintenance. 

That's why today, 
we are adding the ability to have us host it for companies.

This site will live at https://readthedocs.com

Why a .com and a .org
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I love readthedocs.org,
and I never want anything to happen to it.
readthedocs.com is a separate entity,
that has been established to bring Read the Docs to business.

**readthedocs.org will always be free and available for open source docs.**

This has been a lot of work.
Having both live on the same domain would be much easier.
However,
I strongly believe readthedocs.org should never be part of "`an incredible journey`_".
**As part of that, we bootstrapping, and not taking venture funding.**

**The fate of readthedocs.org is not tied to the fate of the business.**
readthedocs.com has been created to help fund our work.
I believe readthedocs.org should be a resource available to the programming community forever,
and we are doing everything in our power to make sure that happens.

Our work creating a company is to help make both the open source and corporate documentation worlds better.
We believe Read the Docs solves a real need in the software world,
and we hope you join us in the next stage.

Our mission is to build world-class documentation tools for developers,
and we would love to have you aboard.

	During this time,
	I've also co-founded `conferences`_ in the US and Europe.
	We're building community around people who care about this issue.
	The conference is also run as a non-profit endeavor,
	in our effort to build community.
