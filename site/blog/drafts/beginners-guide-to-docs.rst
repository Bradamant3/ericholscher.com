Announcing a beginners guide to writing documentation
=====================================================

A few days ago I :doc:`started a campaign </blog/2013/sep/25/help-me-improve-documentation>` to improve documentation.
Now I have the first results to show from the work.

It started first with a `presentation`_ that I presented at PDX Python here in Portland.
The talk was very well recieved,
so I decided to write it up.

So, I present `A beginners guide to writing documentation`_.
It is still very much a work in progress,
so I hope that you can provide feedback.
I welcome you to take this presentation and write up,
modify it, and present it somewhere.

If you think this work is important,
please `support me on Gittip`_ .
