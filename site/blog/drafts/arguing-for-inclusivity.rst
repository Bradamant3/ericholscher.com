Arguing for Inclusivity
=======================

Large changes often start with small things.
Small things are often not done because they aren't large enough.
Changing language is a small thing,
but it can have a large impact.

Often times when you try to change language,
there is a debate about why the change needs to be made.
Folks will argue about the offensivneess of the existing language,
saying that if you aren't offended,
you shouldn't change it.
There is a call of "political correctness",
saying that the change is unneccesary.

I think that we should hold ourselves to a higher standard.
If we are trying to build inclusive and welcoming communities,
"not offensive" isn't enough.
Language should pass the test of "is it welcoming to everyone",
not "might this offend someone".

Framing the qustions in this way makes decisions a lot easier.
If we hope to change our community for the better,
we have to start holding ourselves to a higher standard.
