Help me improve documentation
=============================

A year ago,
I :doc:`asked </blog/2012/sep/20/help-fund-read-docs>` people to help cover the hosting costs of `Read the Docs`_.
It was successful and the site has been funded ever since.

In that time,
I have gone on to do a lot more to help improve documentation in the open source world.
I want to continue to do this work,
with `your help`_.

Work I am doing
---------------

* Developing and maintaining `Read the Docs`_
	* A website that hosts documentation for ~4000 projects, and has over 5 million pageviews/month.
* Co-organizing and producing `Write the Docs conference`_
	* A community, non-profit conference that gathers 250 people in Portland to talk docs
* Helping organize regional Write the Docs meetups
	* We currently have meetups in SF, NYC, and Boston. 
* Writing `documentation`- about documentation
	* A growing resource of information about writing docs
* Writing blog posts and `presentations`_ about documentation
	* Planning to write more
* An unannounced project called Grok the Docs
	* The idea here is to improve documentation through data.

Why it matters
--------------

I have talked to many people around the tech world over the last year,
and they all agree that the state of documentation is lacking.
I want to help improve this situation in many ways.

Read the Docs is the defacto documentation hosting tool for Python.
It has also spread into many other communities,
hosting documentation for PHP, Javascript, C, Java, and Ruby.
It removes barriers to people writing documentation,
allowing them to simply get started down a well paved path.

Through my work on Write the Docs,
we are building a community around documentation.
This community is helping to push the state of the art.
Joining together allows us to present a unified presence for improving documentation in the open source, and proprietary software worlds.

Grok the Docs is a project that is still in development.
The goal is to use analytics data to improve the browsing experience.
It is very much a research project,
but I really hope Grok the Docs will improve the experience of reading and writing documentation.

Budget
------

I quit my job earlier this year to hike the Pacific Crest Trail.
So I currently have very little income,
and hope to work on improving documentation with my time.

I am asking for support on Gittip to help me on this endeavor. 
Currently, my living arrangements cost around **$1200/month**:

	* $500 for Rent & Utilities
	* $300 for Food
	* $250 for Health Insurance
	* $80 for Cell Phone

This works out to around **$300/week**,
which is the way that Gittip keeps track of money.
I hope to achieve independence from money so that I can continue to do work on this important problem.

Support me

If you think that the work that I'm doing is important,
I hope that you support me `on Gittip`_.
