Speaking
========

I enjoy speaking at tech conferences quite a bit.
I have always had an interest in teaching,
and I believe that conference presentations are one of the best ways to teach in a professional setting.

I am interested in speaking on the following topics:

    * Documentation
    * Read the Docs
    * Leading Open Source Projects

If you would like me to speak at your event,
feel free to `email me`_
