Backpacking
===========

Backpacking is a hobby that I have recently picked up since moving to the Pacific Northwest. 


Mount Hood
----------

I started taking trips around Mount Hood to get my experience in the field. 


Pacific Crest Trail
-------------------

I walked on the Pacific Crest Trail from April 15 - June 16 in 2013. 
I had to come home due to a stress fracture in my third metatarsal in my left food.
