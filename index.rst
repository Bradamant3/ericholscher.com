Welcome to Surfing in Kansas
============================

Welcome to the home of Eric Holscher on the web. I talk about software development, mostly in the realm of Django. I am interested in the real time web, testing, mobile apps, and other things.

I am currently walking the `Pacific Crest Trail <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail>`_, in a quest for the holy grail. My journey lasts from April 15, 2013, until some time in the future :) I will be writing quite a bit about that as well.
